	The concept revolves around the beginning of a digital/electronic shut down in Yelahanka due to radiating fumes emitted from cow dung patty that are splattered on the streets. The hidden story-line behind this concept would be that an old man experiments with the fodder fed to cattle with the intention of eliminating modern technology from the area. The superstitious residents blame the events on a neglected goddess. Curious students/investigators begin researching these unusual events.

<h6>Stakeholders and characters: </h6>
Old man(villain), investigators, students/teens/shopkeeper (experiencing electronic malfunction), hospital nurse, cows, residents dumping garbage, residents neglecting goddess.


<h6>Working of the game:</h6>
There is an old man who is the villain in the game trying to make the town entirely electronically malfunctioned. The player who plays the old man has to complete the task of blacking out the entire town without electronics.
